### Assignment 02

This is the undergrad assignment, attempted for extra credit. This code will therefore be messier than the graduate assignment, and has not been tested. I literally wrote the code, checked to make sure it compilied, and called it a day. Entire time spent from importing grad code to completion was about an hour or so.

Usage: prog02 input output

esc quits

left decreases gamma

right increases gamma

down decreases gain

up increases gain

down decreases gain

a decreases bias

d increases bias

v decreases radius

b increases radius

n and m change convolution kernel type
